# Lorem Ipsum Text Generator

This is a simple web application built using several technologies to generate Lorem Ipsum text paragraphs based on user-specified counts.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the application [here](https://www.figma.com/file/JRDDc3aN6uiBS3yvjbkk0s/Lorem-ipsum?node-id=0%3A1&t=cLtQmBowNmb4V0jP-1).

## Features

- Explore and generate Lorem Ipsum text paragraphs.
- Set the number of paragraphs to generate.
- Display the generated text with unique paragraph IDs.

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for application logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **nanoid**: A library for generating unique IDs in JavaScript.
- **npm**: The Node.js package manager for managing project dependencies.

## Usage

### Explore Data

Navigate to the `data.js` file to explore the array of Lorem Ipsum text data.

### Count State Value

In `App.jsx`, the count state value is set up using the `useState` hook with a default value of 1.

### Form

A form element is set up in `App.jsx` that contains a number input and a submit button. The count state value is attached to the input using the `value` prop. The minimum value is set to 1, the maximum value to 8, and the step to 1.

### Import Text and State Value

The text array is imported from `data.js`, and a text state value is set up using the `useState` hook with a default value of an empty array.

### OnSubmit

An `onSubmit` event is attached to the form, and a `handleSubmit` function handles the form submission. Inside the `handleSubmit` function, the default form submission behavior is prevented using `event.preventDefault()`. The count state value is used to create a new array by extracting the first `n` paragraphs from the text array (where `n` is the count state value). The text state value is set to the new array using `array.slice()`.

### Render Text

The text state value is rendered below the form using the `map` method to iterate over the array and render each paragraph with a unique ID generated by the `nanoid` library.
